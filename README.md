Python code to:

Calibrate an implied volatility surface from option market prices.

Compute the local volatility surface using Dupire's formula.

Simulate asset price paths using both the Heston stochastic volatility model and the Dupire local volatility model.

Price European call options using these models.

Compare option prices generated by the Dupire model against “true” prices from the Heston model as the underlying evolves over time.

Visualize and analyze the convergence behavior of the two models.
